## What is an WIP?

WIP stands for Wisdom Improvement Proposal. An WIP is a design document providing information to the Wisdom community, or describing a new feature for Wisdom or its processes or environment. The WIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The WIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
