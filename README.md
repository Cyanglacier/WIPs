# Contributing
People wishing to submit WIPs, do as belows

1. Review WIP-1.
2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
3. Add your WIP to your fork of the repository. There is a template WIP here.
4. Submit a Pull Request to Ethereum's EIPs repository.

Having a WIP here does not make it a formally accepted stardard until its status becomes Final or Active.Your first PR should be a first draft of the final WIP. we will manually review the draft and assign it a number.  

If your WIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that WIP as follow: assets/wip-X (for wip X). When linking to an image in the WIP, use relative links such as ../assets/wip-X/image.png. 

Once your first PR is merged, we have a bot that helps out by automatically merging PRs to draft WIPs. For this to work, it has to be able to tell that you own the draft being edited. Make sure that the 'author' line of your WIP contains either your Github username or your email address inside . If you use your email address, that address must be the one publicly shown on your GitHub profile.you should use markdown grammar to edit the WIP.
